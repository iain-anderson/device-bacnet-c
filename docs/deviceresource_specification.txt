DeviceResource Specification (Attributes)

The DeviceResources of BACnet each contains four attributes: type, instance,
property, and index.

The type attribute is the BACnet object type. The common object types
analog-input, analog-output, analog-value, binary-input, binary-output, binary-value
and device may be specified as strings, other object types must be specified
with their type number (these can be found in bacenum.h of the BACnet stack
(http://bacnet.sourceforge.net/).

The instance attribute is the object instance which is an integer.

The property attribute is the property to be read. This defaults to
present-value but alternatively object-name may be specified, or any other BACnet
property may be indicated by number (again these are listed in bacenum.h in
the BACnet stack).

The index attribute is the array index of the property. If no index
attribute is given, the index defaults to none.

An example of the attributes of a deviceResource in JSON can be seen here:

"attributes": { "type": "analog-input", "instance": 4, "property": "present-value" }
