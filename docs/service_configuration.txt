Service Configuration ([Driver] Options)

The BACnet device service can be configured by adding certain
properties to the [Driver] section of the TOML configuration.
The service must be restarted for any changes to take effect.

BACnet IP:
BACnet IP can be configured using the [Driver] section of the TOML file. The
properties which can be set are BBMD_ADDRESS and BBMD_PORT. BBMD_ADDRESS should point to
the IP address of a BACnet BBMD device, for instance 10.100.22.243, and
BBMD_PORT should point to the port of a BACnet BBMD device, for instance 47809.
An example of this can be seen here:

[Driver]
  BBMD_ADDRESS = "10.100.22.243"
  BBMD_PORT = 47809

BACnet MSTP:
BACnet MSTP can be configured using the [Driver] section of the TOML file. If a
property named DefaultDevicePath is added to the TOML file, the corresponding
string is used as the device path for the device service. If DefaultDevicePath
is not set, /dev/ttyUSB0 will be used. An example of a DefaultDevicePath in
TOML can be seen here:

[Driver]
  DefaultDevicePath = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
